# Upgrading

What changes for people moving to a newer Orbit build: behavior that is different, who notices and what to do about it.

Orbit does not use Changesets, so a pull request that changes behavior someone can see adds its note to this file in the
same pull request, under the section for the area it touches. Refactors, and fixes that only restore documented
behavior, need no note.

Add a note at the end of its section. Each note is a short heading and three parts:

```md
### Short title of the change

What changed, and what it did before.

**Affects:** who notices, for example scripts that call `orb run`, VS Code users or SDK callers.

**What to do:** the step to take, or "Nothing" when existing setups keep working.
```

## Clients

Changes to the terminal UI, the `orb` command line, the client libraries and SDK, and the VS Code extension.
